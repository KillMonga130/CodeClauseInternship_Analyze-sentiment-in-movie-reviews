# Sentiment Analysis in Movie Reviews

This project implements sentiment analysis in movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

## Project Overview

- **Aim**: Apply NLP techniques to preprocess text data and build a sentiment analysis model.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NLTK or SpaCy.
- **Project Level**: Entry Level.
- **Start Date**: 01 April 2024.
- **End Date**: 01 May 2024.

## Description

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Obtaining movie reviews dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing text data using NLTK or SpaCy.
3. Feature Engineering: Generating TF-IDF vectors for text representation.
4. Model Building: Training a logistic regression model for sentiment analysis.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

## Files Included

- `CodeClouse00.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for sentiment analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- Other data files or resources used in the project.

## Usage

To run the code:

1. Ensure you have Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the required libraries installed.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `CodeClouse00.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
